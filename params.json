{"name":"Snakebot Game","tagline":"Brookwood High School AI Programming Competition in Java","body":"### What is the SnakeBot Game?\r\nThe SnakeBot Game is a java programming contest created by Amaan Marfatia. The point of the contest is to create an AI to play against other players. This is mainly intended for AP Computer Science students but since it is easy to pick up, anyone in middle school or high school can submit an AI.\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nThis game is similar to snakes where you try to eat food and grow in length. The difference is, that you have to create an an AI that plays the game for you against another team's AI. Each AI starts in one of the corners with the length of one. The winner is the AI that reaches the length of ten or doesn't die. Every time you eat a food piece on the board, your snake increases by the length of one.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
